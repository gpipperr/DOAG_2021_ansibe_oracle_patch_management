# DOAG 2021 Ansibe Oracle Patch Management

DOAG 2021 Conference -  Automate Database Maintenance and Patch Management with Ansible

Source Code of the presentation


Ansible is a very well developed and free tool for configuration and management.

With this tool it is possible to automate the patch management of the database environment and it is ideal to achieve a standardized environment with the same settings and scripts on all machines.

With Ansible it is possible to replace the DB option "Oracle Database Lifecycle Management Pack"; with the great advantage that non-Oracle components can be completely covered.
